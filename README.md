# Packages
* React
* Styled Components

# Other Information
* Designs were followed as close as possible with time restraint. They may not be completely perfect or spot on, but I wanted to limit time spent as recommended.
* I was unsure as to whether or not design questions needed to be placed here. If so, I can update this README with the proper questions.
